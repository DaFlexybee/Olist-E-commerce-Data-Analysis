# Olist-E-commerce-Data-Analysis
A data analysis challenge was recently held in the Data tech space, and we were tasked as participants with exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the Olist E-commerce Public Dataset.
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses with customers all over the country. The platform functions as a marketplace, with merchants listing their products and services and customers browsing and purchasing them online.
